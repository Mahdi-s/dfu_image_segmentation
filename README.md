# Semantic Segmentation of DFU Images
## Overview
This repository contains code for performing semantic segmentation on Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) images. It includes two primary experiments:

1. Central Experiment: This approach utilizes a centralized machine learning model.
2. Federated Experiment: This experiment demonstrates a federated learning approach to the same problem.
### Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8
- Pip package manager
### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   
```git clone [URL of your repository]```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
### Central Experiment

The central_experiment.ipynb notebook contains the code for the central experiment. To run this notebook:

1. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   
```jupyter notebook central_experiment.ipynb```

3. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the experiment.

### Federated Experiment

The federated_experiment.ipynb notebook includes the code for the federated learning experiment. Follow these steps to run it:

1. Ensure the requirements are installed as mentioned above.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```jupyter notebook federated_experiment.ipynb```

3. Execute the cells within the notebook to see federated learning in action.
